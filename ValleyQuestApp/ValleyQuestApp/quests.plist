		<string>To Get There:  This Quest begins at the Ledyard Canoe Club (LCC).  LCC is located at the north end of the parking lot on the east (Hanover) side of the Ledyard Bridge.  Please note: You will need a canoe or kayak to complete this Quest!  They can be rented at the LCC.</string>

		<string>This lovely log cabin was built in &apos;52,
But WHY? Give a listen and I&apos;ll tell you...
The Wilder Dam is found just downstream,
When it was built it caused quite a scene.</string>
		<key>Clue11</key>
		<string>The water upstream was raised 15 feet,
Submerging three islands whole-what a feat!
Chase, Occum, and Johnny Johnson were their names,
Now these islands exist only in fame.</string>
		<key>Clue12</key>
		<string>Now Ledyard had cabins on these islands three,
But when the water got high they could no longer be.
So the club rented land from New England Power
On this island, called &quot;Gilman,&quot; that used to be &quot;Nicker.&quot;</string>
		<key>Clue13</key>
		<string>Since Ledyard Canoe Club had cabins no longer,
This one you see here was built to be stronger
(and higher above that dam&apos;s water line
that swallowed up those others so fine).</string>
		<key>Clue14</key>
		<string>Behind the cabin, there&apos;s a rock with a blaze,
So carefully climb to the top to continue this maze.
You&apos;ll observe that the trail has changed just a bit.
The land is more rugged; make sure you don&apos;t trip!</string>
		<key>Clue15</key>
		<string>Along the isle&apos;s ridge, like an explorer you walk,
Keep marching along, keep an eye on the clock.
This may take a while, be patient my friend,
And remember to enjoy this Quest &apos;til the end.</string>
		<key>Clue16</key>

So keep to the LEFT for your treasure so dear.
Continue along, seeking orange tree paint,
If the water is still to your right, then you are a saint.</string>
		<key>Clue17</key>
		<string>&apos;Round a bend, up a hill, keep walking to find
A green-painted table of the picnicky kind.
It should be sitting quite close to a circle of stone,
You have now arrived in the Quest box zone!</string>
		<key>Clue18</key>
		<string>Sit at the table with your back to the fire,
Look straight ahead-a dead birch you desire.
The water should be to your right and behind, 
Now 25 paces &apos;til the dead birch you find.</string>
		<key>Clue19</key>
		<string>The logs are all rotting, just lying around, 
But look to the stump that still stands in the ground.
At the stump&apos;s base, please carefully seek-
Out from a birch &quot;sleeve&quot; the box should peek.</string>
		<key>Clue2</key>
		<string>Head from the docks and the house for canoes,
Paddle toward the bridge upon this water so blue.
This river and valley are older than you know,
Formed by a glacial lake oh so many years ago.</string>
		<key>Clue20</key>
		<string>Sign in, collect the stamp, and place it carefully back
For other clever Questers who are on the right track.

		<key>Clue1</key>
		<string>To get there: Travel north on  Route 10 to Reservoir Road.  Turn and travel east on Reservoir Road until you see the Bernice A. Ray School.  Turn left into the school parking lot and park.  The Quest begins by the entrance to the gym.</string>
		<key>Clue10</key>
		<string>Bear right down a paved road. Once you have reached the bottom of the road, there will be tennis courts and a pool to your right. Go to the parking lot nearest to the pond and look to the left and you will see a white billboard standing so lonely. Go and visit this board. Here you shall learn of the pondÃ­s water quality.</string>
		<key>Clue11</key>
		<string>Take a right and pause at the swings. Find a seat and swing away. Enjoy the views of maples in front of you. Mosey past the swings and soon you will arrive at Storr&apos;s Smores. You can grab a quick snack to quench your Questing hunger!</string>
		<key>Clue12</key>
		<string>Pass the snack bar on the left and soon you will come to a small, wooden footbridge.  Walk to the middle of the bridge and you will see a rock-bedded stream; tadpoles and water striders jump about and may be seen. </string>
		<key>Clue13</key>
		<string>Walk back across the bridge the way you came and follow the paved path to the left to yet another parking lot. Traverse across the parking area until you reach a basketball court. Past the courts are two trails, one steep and the other shallow.</string>
		<key>Clue14</key>
		<string>Choose the one not shallow and do not stand still. Follow the narrow footpath that shall lead you eventually back to the great blue walls of the Ray School. Keep an eye out for garter snakes and red squirrels that may dart across your path.</string>
		<key>Clue15</key>
		<string>The footpath widens gradually so that two people may walk side by side. Upon arriving at a clearing in the woods you will spy two birdhouses to your left. If you are lucky you may see a chickadee dining.</string>
		<key>Clue16</key>
		<string>Here, the path diverges; take the small path to your right. Find a grand hemlock tree swaying so gracefully. If you look carefully under the branches you may discover an informative treasure.
</string>
		<key>Clue17</key>
		<string>TO GET BACK TO THE PARKING LOT: Continue up the path. Soon you will arrive at a very large, steep hill. The path becomes narrower. If you walk up the steep path, you will be back at the Ray School.</string>
		<key>Clue18</key>
		<string>Take an immediate right and follow the building until you are returned safe and sound to the parking lot from which you began your Quest.</string>
		<key>Clue2</key>
		<string>Upon arriving at the Ray School back parking lot by the gym, look straight ahead and take the tree-lined trail cut out from the field.  Look to your left and look to the right, and see Queen Anne&apos;s lace and Buttercups bow their heads gracefully in the breeze.</string>
		<key>Clue3</key>
		<string>Continue down the path until you spy a dark, wooden, colonial house.  Go to the maple tree to the left of the house.  From there, face the wire fencing that keeps &quot;Shamrock.&quot;  Take a moment to learn of the great deeds he performs.</string>
		<key>Clue4</key>
		<string>Look straight ahead and enter a pine needle-covered forest floor.  Look above and all around you and you shall see a stand of white pine trees. Look a little closer and you may discover black cherry, red maple, yellow birch, poplar, white ash, brown ash, and maybe even a basswood.</string>
		<key>Clue5</key>
		<string>The competition has eliminated many trees to the point where today-in 2002-there are about 2,000 - 3,000 trees per acre.  But by the time the trees here have matured in 2060 or 2080 only 150 trees per acre will remain.</string>
		<key>Clue6</key>
		<string>As you walk through this stand, see if you can find trees that have recently died, as well as trees that have been dead for a long time.
Continue down the steep hill until you arrive at an intersection.</string>
		<key>Clue7</key>
		<string>The path diverges: take a right and you shall see a U-shaped tree with a yellow circular marker.  Follow the path until you reach a massive, mossy, decaying log. Explore it delicately, so as not to disrupt the termites and beetles that make their home in the detritus matter.</string>
		<key>Clue8</key>
		<string>At this point you should be in a small clearing in the forest.  Seek a small, fern-lined path immediately to your left. Follow a dip and then up a bit until you come to a road in front of you. Come to a stop at a rock-filled ditch. </string>
		<key>Clue9</key>
		<string>This is a drainage canal that controls runoff from the road. In front of you there should be 8 large logs all lined up as seats. You are now at campground &quot;A&quot; of Storr&apos;s Pond. </string>

		<key>Clue20</key>
		<string>Soon the path up the hill fades,

But first we go off in another way.

Two Dartmouth libraries side by side.

Go in (if it is open) four columns you&apos;ve seen before
Two located on either side of the door.
</string>

At the top of the hill, turn right at the light onto Main Street.  In .6 miles, turn left onto Brook Road.  Continue on Brook Road for .2 miles.  Parking will be on your right. </string>
		<key>Clue10</key>
		<string>To help with the problem, use native or non-invasive plants at home.
Never release aquarium plants into streams, for the plants might roam.
Be careful to remove all plant material from boats as well.
This keeps water milfoil, water chestnut, and zebra mussels from spreading, I tell.</string>
		<key>Clue11</key>
		<string>On the trail a little further, pine and hemlock abound.
Continue up the rise past a stone wall that follows the ground.
Take a right onto the Brook Loop and enjoy the water again.
In early spring you&apos;ll find a lot of suckers here and their kin.</string>
		<key>Clue12</key>
		<string>In the last week of April and first week of May,
Suckers move up the brook, jumping up waterfalls so gay.
Continue on this trail-following the blue arrow.
It&apos;s the main trail you want, not the one that is narrow.</string>
		<key>Clue13</key>
		<string>Now at the intersection, the Quest you will not fail.

Horsetails is another name for this plant that is not rare.
It is useful for anchoring the soil. Look at it close.
See its jointed stems. It can poison livestock if they get too high a dose</string>
		<key>Clue16</key>
		<string>As you make the bend the land slopes up quite a bit.

Find the oldest you can and the youngest one too.</string>

In the stone wall is a hole, where the Quest box now faces.</string>

		<string>Wonderful at rodent control, mink can kill and store prey.

		<key>Clue4</key>
		<string>An alder tree will be on your left as you look at the view.
On the right are tall willow trees, of which there are two.
Both of these tree species can be found by brooks.
They need soil, this moist, to help their good looks.  </string>
		<key>Clue5</key>
		<string>Each alder tree leaf scar has a round face with eyes
And a tiny nose looks at you with surprise.
Alder trees anchor stream banks, containing the motion.
Their roots are essential to preventing soil erosion.</string>
		<key>Clue6</key>
		<string>Return back to the main trail and continue &apos;til a house.
Listen to the sound of the water.  Be as quiet as a mouse.
This sound is made by bubbles breaking. 
Under the rocks, animal homes in the making.</string>
		<key>Clue7</key>
		<string>Continue on the main trail, not two trails right.
Bend to the left where the crabapple tree is in sight.
Look on both sides for the riverbank grape, a vine with tendrils to climb.
Grouse, fox, turkey and other wildlife upon its fruit dine.
</string>
		<key>Clue8</key>
		<string>The trail continues to a small meadow where ripples abound,
A place where animal tracks can be found,
On the sandbar, raccoons, foxes, mink... even bear,
Have left footprints when drinking and hunting with care.</string>
		<key>Clue9</key>
		<string>As you go on, European buckthorn is on the right,
When it&apos;s thick it out-competes native plants for sunlight.
It also is a glutton for nutrients and space,
So wildlife loses native food at a far too rapid pace.

		<string>To get there: Take I-89 to Exit 17. Take Rte. 4 east 4 miles to Enfield. Take the second right past the Enfield Garage (High St.) just as Rte. 4 makes a sharp left into town. At the first stop sign, go straight through the intersection.</string>
		<key>Clue10</key>
		<string>This area was once marsh, soggy and wet,
With no place to run a train through...yet.
Rail workers piled dirt high across this wet spot,
Until it was set and their backs were in knots.</string>
		<key>Clue11</key>
		<string>To the right of this bank, is a rich habitat,
A wetland home for many a duck, in fact.
Explore a little and you may see
A frog, a turtle, a heron...lucky thee!
</string>
		<key>Clue12</key>
		<string>The next bridge makes us stop and wonder:
Who built this so cars take turns going under?
The Shakers built the big bridge across the lake
To get to the rail depot without effort great.
Did they tunnel under here and thus this bridge?
Give a friendly wave to those who way give.</string>
		<key>Clue13</key>
		<string>The Quest is over, when rock walls appear.
&quot;Ledges Pass&quot; they are called, the end is near.
Two gangs of workers, forty men, they say,
Took a year to carve this cut, with nary a stay.
Gas or steam engines were not yet the rule,
Hand drills and explosives their only tools.</string>
		<key>Clue14</key>
		<string>Upon these walls are etched names and dates,
By workers whose sweat this passage did make.
At the end of the pass on the left is a rock,

		<key>Clue15</key>
		<string>Questers please note: At the far end of the pass, there is a trail that leads to the shore of the lake. Once you are on the trail, you are on the private property of Mr. Earl Farnham. Please respect his beautiful property, and be aware that you are passing at your own risk. </string>

		<string>Take the first left onto Depot Street. Park at the end of Depot St. in the parking lot to the left of the red building. This building is the old Enfield railroad depot, but now houses the town ambulances. Please make sure not to block the emergency vehicles in any way.
</string>
		<key>Clue3</key>
		<string>In eighteen hundred and forty seven,
Enfield folk thought they&apos;d gone to heaven.
To this depot they and their cargo could now roll
To ride the brand new Northern Railroad.</string>

Victims of highways and air travel throngs.

All aboard this historical Rail Trail Quest!</string>
		<key>Clue6</key>
		<string>Before the railroad came, this area, it is said,
Was mostly farms and a few homesteads.
The train was a magnet for prosperity,
Thus the shops, mills and village that you see.</string>
		<key>Clue7</key>
		<string>Next stop is the bridge over Mascoma River,
The bridge or the rapids might make you quiver.
Instead think back to how water helped fill a hole
Left behind by a glacier, before humans strolled.</string>
		<key>Clue8</key>
		<string>On the left is Mascoma Lake, long and deep,
Named after an ancient Squakheag Indian Chief.
His village was in Mass., far away in those days,
But his tribe hunted this far North, anyway.
</string>
		<key>Clue9</key>
		<string>The trail up ahead appears flat and straight,

		<key>Clue11</key>
		<string>Now look for a brick house as you journey along and I&apos;ll tell you of a poltergeist&apos;s song.
This house underwent re-construction to return it to its original state.  It was then that the owners heard the ghost.  It banged boards together and slammed doors.  When the re-construction was done, the ghosts&apos; noises disappeared.</string>
		<key>Clue12</key>
		<string>At the next crosswalk you will do just that; and come to some grand trees upon a large lawn.  Can you identify these large evergreens?  Let&apos;s hope they never have to be sawn.

		<key>Clue13</key>
		<string>Onward to a place where you can sleep and eat while resting your very weary feet.

		<key>Clue14</key>
		<string>Keep traveling north along Main.  Go to place you would visit if your tooth had a pain.
Moses Willard, an occupant of the fort, built this house.

		<key>Clue18</key>
		<string>You are looking for the gravestone of Moses and Susannah Willard, who were killed by Indians June 16th of 1756.  Pay your respects to these fort settlers buried here.
Now look straight ahead, slightly to your left, for a chalice standing high in the sky.
It is the Johnson&apos;s burial spot, also settlers of the fort.</string>
		<key>Clue19</key>
		<string>The people from the fort have been here a long time but so has something that is living.
Can you guess what it may be?  Look ahead at the edge of the woods.

It&apos;s almost time to find our treasure, which is very near.
Facing the tree turn right and head down the road.
Be careful not to step on a toad!</string>
		<key>Clue21</key>
		<string>Along the way, go to a white pillar on your right (a memorial) just this one more.
In memory to those taken captive by the Indians in 1754.
Now facing west go down the stone steps you came up.
The treasure is where the pine tree leaves the earth.
Shouldn&apos;t it be &quot;one&quot; instead of &quot;some&quot; then?</string>
		<key>Clue22</key>
		<string>Insert period
Should be &quot;ghost&apos;s&quot;
Out of curiosity-careful how?  With the construction?  With his hammer?
Insert &quot;a&quot;
George suggests using the term &quot;double-stoned slab&quot; instead, as there is another &quot;Moses Willard&quot; stone near the first oak tree.
Do we need to be PC?</string>
		<key>Clue3</key>
		<string>Please park in back of the fire station, well out of the way.</string>
		<key>Clue4</key>

The very first house on the left is where you are bound.

They returned to Charlestown after a ransom was paid.
The original cabin is hidden underneath the modern exterior.</string>
		<key>Clue5</key>
		<string>Keep heading south.  Do you hear the sound of a bell?  
Is it the church or the brick house next to it that would ring so well?
It is the brick house that in 1772 was built as a one- room schoolhouse.  This is the oldest schoolhouse in Charlestown and it held 40 students, the youngest learning their ABC&apos;s and the oldest algebra.</string>
		<key>Clue6</key>
		<string>Continue down the sidewalk quite a ways, until a pizza parlor comes into your gaze.
You could stop in to have a bite to eat, but when you&apos;re done go back outside and cross the street.  The place you should find yourself to be is in front of the Silsby Public Library. </string>
		<key>Clue7</key>
		<string>The library holds a lot of interesting things, including a carved wooden eagle (seen from the side door) and some of Charles Hoyt&apos;s plays (one of only five in existence).</string>

		<string>Travel south yet once again, to the site of what was the Walker Tavern where you were once able to go right in.  This stone house was the home of Mary Walker whom was the great granddaughter of an original grantee of  # 4.  The &quot;stone cottage&quot; as it is commonly called, used to be the Walker Tavern. </string>
		<key>Clue9</key>
		<string>It had a sign with a beehive and bees on it, just like the Beehive Tavern of Philadelphia.  I&apos;ll mention here as a last note, this place is haunted by two ghosts!  (Oh I almost forgot to say, so was the first house along the way.)</string>

Stop on the third and quench your thirst.</string>
